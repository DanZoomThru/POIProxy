A proxy service to retrieve POIs from several public services

To run POIProxy in a servlet container (i.e. Tomcat), clone the es.alrocar.poiproxy.rest project and run:

mvn jetty:run

Note: The services configuration should be located at: /var/lib/sp/services

To run POIProxy in Google AppEngine, clone the es.alrocar.poiproxy.gae and run:

mvn gae:run

Both projects depend on es.alrocar.poiproxy.
